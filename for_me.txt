So i want to set up this directory to test Mac M1 GPU support for training and running BPNet.
I have the bpnet-refactor repo cloned, i have the environment set up.

I would like to create an automatic env set up. I have this as a yml file 'bpnet-m1.yml'
I would also like to create an automatic env set up test (testing imports of everything and availability of Mac MPS)

I then would like to create some scripts that set everything up from cloning the bpnet-refactor repo - have to know the specific version too for reproducibility
- should include data imports and precomputation... these scripts already exist, I just want them organized
- I basically want some sort of pipeline situation where things are run from env setup to testing env, to data setup automatically
- Do this all the way until actual model training because this is when I want to do tests
- talk about the file structure to use to run the tests of BPNet on M1 but don't do anything
