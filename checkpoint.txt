CHECKPOINT: How to revert to current state before implementing generalized pipeline

Current git commit: 90a151e BEFORE CLAUDE CHANGES

To revert all changes and return to current state:

1. Reset to the checkpoint commit:
   git reset --hard 90a151e

2. Force push to remote (if needed):
   git push origin main --force-with-lease

3. Verify clean state:
   git status

This will restore the exact state before implementing the generalized pipeline changes.

Alternative - if you want to keep commit history:
1. Create a new branch from current state:
   git checkout -b revert-generalized-pipeline 90a151e

2. Switch back to main:
   git checkout main
