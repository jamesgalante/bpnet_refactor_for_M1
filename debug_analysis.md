# Performance Testing Debug Analysis

## Issue Analysis from Output:
1. **Progress parsing broken**: Shows "1/1622 steps" instead of actual "77/1622"
2. **Old timing logic still used**: Shows 90-91 seconds instead of true training time
3. **Analysis script can't find logs**: Looking in wrong directory
4. **Steps per minute = 0**: Because it's using wrong progress numbers

## Root Causes Found:

### grid_search.sh Issues:
1. **Line 220**: `steps_per_minute=$((steps_completed * 60 / time_elapsed))` uses 90-second timeout, NOT true training time
2. **Line 231**: CSV writes `$time_elapsed` (90s) instead of calculated training duration
3. **Timestamp logic**: Adds "Training ended at:" but never USES it for calculation

### analyze_logs.sh Issues:
1. **Line 24**: `ls training_*t_*b.log` looks in current directory, not performance_testing/
2. **Line 95**: `python3 scripts/performance/analyze_grid_search.py .` passes wrong directory

## Fixes Needed:
1. âœ… Replace `$time_elapsed` with timestamp-based duration calculation in grid_search.sh
2. Fix analyze_logs.sh to look in performance_testing/ directory
3. Progress parsing IS working (captures 77, 52) - just need to use correct duration

## TODO List:
4. **Auto-run analysis**: Grid search should automatically run analysis at the end, not require separate command
5. **Single command workflow**: User runs one script, gets complete results including visualizations
